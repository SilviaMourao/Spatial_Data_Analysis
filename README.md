## Overview

This project focuses on the spatial analysis of free WiFi access points in Italy, specifically within the Lazio region and the city of Rome. The objective was to identify the distribution pattern of these access points, assess spatial autocorrelation, understand regional characteristics that influence this distribution, and analyze optimal paths for tourists in Rome based on WiFi coverage.

The project explores various spatial data analysis techniques such as point pattern analysis, area-based spatial analysis, regression models (ordinary least squares and spatial regression), spatial interpolation, and network analysis. These methods allowed for a thorough exploration of WiFi distribution patterns, identification of coverage gaps, and analysis of signal availability for optimal tourist routing within Rome.

## Conclusion of the Report

This project successfully demonstrated the use of spatial data analysis techniques to evaluate WiFi access point distribution and coverage. The results highlighted that WiFi coverage is clustered around densely populated areas, especially in Rome, but significant gaps remain in the network, particularly in peripheral regions. Regression models showed that variables such as tourist hotspots, hotels, and nightlife areas can predict WiFi access point locations with high accuracy. The final network analysis also illustrated that WiFi coverage is not yet sufficient for continuous tourist routes, indicating areas for infrastructure improvement.
